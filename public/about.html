  Aaron is a coder and developer living in Dallas TX. He's been incredibly interested in web development since his first computer back in the early 90s.
</p>

<p>Aaron spent an impressive amount of time learning how to build web pages in MS Publisher, but before long he found himself limited by the tool. He took to
  the web to start understanding HTML and CSS. While it hasn't been a focus of his career in IT, Aaron has always had a passion for web development and coding. 
  He's taken it upon himself to learn PowerShell, PHP, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and others, and has always found a creative outlet in the world of code. 
</p>

<p>Now it's time to focus on something new, so Aaron is starting back at the basics to beef up his understanding and knowledge of web development and coding, and improve his ability
  to build what he sees in his mind. He is eagerly diving into more HTML and CSS with a big helping of Node.js, React, and other modern tools to help him succeed.
